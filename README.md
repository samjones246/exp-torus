# exp-torus
Auto solver for the torus puzzle minigame in Exponential Idle.
This code was originally written by Reddit user u/oskolokolakapulka, I've just adapted it to work for my phone (Samsung Galaxy S9).
Requires Python 3 and Tesseract to be installed, and a working ADB connection to your device.
To use, install requirements with 'pip install -r requirements.txt' and run the program wuth 'python tess.py'
This probably won't work for you without any adaptation, but if it does that's cool.
